# Custom Event ðŸ›Ž

The TOAST UI Grid has a powerful event system which provides ways to extend custom functionality on top of the built-in features. 

## Attach / Detach event handlers

To attach a handler to a specific event, you can use the public method `on()`. The first argument is a name of target event, and the second argument is a handler to attach. 

```javascript
import Grid from 'tui-grid';

const grid = new Grid({
  // optionsâ€¦
});

grid.on('click', function() {
  console.log('clicked!!');
})

grid.on('dblclick', function() {
  console.log('double clicked!!');
});
```

To detach a handler from a specific event, you can use the public method `off()`. Like the `on()` method, the first argument is a name of target event. The second argument is handler attached, but it is optional. If you don't use the second argument, all handlers attached to the event is detached.

```javascript
grid.off('click');
// or
grid.off('click', onClickHandler);
```

## Adding Event Handlers Using Option Configurations

You can also directly set up the event handlers using the Grid's options. Such event handlers cannot be added using the `on()` instance method, and does not need to be removed using the `off()`. The event handlers that can be added using the option configurations are `onBeforeChange()`, `onAfterChange()`, `onGridMounted()`, and `onGridBeforeDestroy()`, and respective configurations are further detailed in examples below.

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
  // ...,
  columns: [
    {
      header: 'Name',
      name: 'name',
      onBeforeChange(ev) {
        console.log('Before change:' + ev);
      },
      onAfterChange(ev) {
        console.log('After change:' + ev);
      },
      editor: 'text',
    }
  ],
  onGridMounted(ev) {
    console.log('mounted' + ev);
  },
  onGridBeforeDestroy(ev) {
    console.log('before destroy' + ev);
  }
});
```

## GridEvent
When an event occurs, an instance of the `GridEvent` instance is passed to the handler attached to the event. It has useful information which can be used by event handler. For example, if the `click` event occurs, `rowKey`, `targetType` and `columnName` value is set to the `GridEvent` instance so that user can figure out the address of the target cell.

```javascript
grid.on('click', function(ev) {
  if (ev.rowKey === 3 && ev.columnName === 'col1') {
    // do something
  }
});
```

The `GridEvent` instance also has the `stop()` method which can be used to prevent default action of the event. For example, if you want to prevent for a specific row not to be selected, you can attach a handler to the `click` event and call the `ev.stop()`.

```javascript
grid.on('click', function(ev) {
  if (ev.rowKey === 3) {
    ev.stop();  
  }
});
```

The `GridEvent` instance can have a `nativeEvent` property, this is the browser's native events like `click`, `mousedown` and so on.

```javascript
grid.on('mousedown', function(ev) {
  console.log(ev.nativeEvent);
});
```
