# Custom Column Header ðŸ”§
TOAST UI Grid provides a feature that allows you to customize the column header's UI. 

Similar to the [custom renderer](./custom-renderer.md), you can use the constructor function `HeaderRenderer` interface to customize the column headers. TOAST UI Grid uses the constructor function `HeaderRenderer` registered by the user to create an instance internally and adds the returned element to the DOM. While it is recommended to declare the custom column headers with the `class` keyword, but keywords `function` and `prototype` are also accepted. 


The following is the interface for the `HeaderRenderer`. (For the structure of the `HeaderRenderer`'s interface, refer to [types/renderer/index.d.ts](https://github.com/nhn/tui.grid/blob/master/packages/toast-ui.grid/types/renderer/index.d.ts).)

* `constructor`
The constructor function is called every time the column header (`<th>`) is added to the DOM. Generally, it serves to store the root elements as instance members. The elements created using this method can be accessed by `getElement()` method. The object's interfaces that are passed as the constructor function's parameters are as follow. 
  | Property | Type | Return Type |
  |--------|--------|--------|
  | `grid` | `Grid` | The `grid` property references the Grid instance. It can be useful when retrieving a certain piece of data from the Grid or manipulating the Grid directly. |
  | `columnInfo` | `ColumnHeaderInfo` | `columnInfo` property contains all information that is relevant to each column header. More information regarding `ColumnHeaderInfo` interface can be found [here](https://github.com/nhn/tui.grid/blob/master/packages/toast-ui.grid/types/renderer/index.d.ts). |

* `getElement`
Returns the root DOM element of the column header. When a column header (`<th>` element) is added, the returned element will be inserted as a child. 
* `mounted`
This parameter is `optional` and is used to initialize the input elements. This method is called immediately after the root element returned from the `getElement()` method is has been added to the DOM. 
* `render` 
This parameter is used to synchronize the state of the column headers. 
* `beforeDestroy`
This parameter is `optional` and can be used to delete an input element. This method is called immediately before the element returned from the `getElement()` is removed from the DOM. 

The following code is an example of the custom column header. 

```javascript
class CustomColumnHeader {
  constructor(props) {
    const columnInfo = props.columnInfo;
    const el = document.createElement('div');
    el.className = 'custom';
    el.textContent = `custom_${columnInfo.header}`;
    this.el = el;
  }

  getElement() {
    return this.el;
  }

  render(props) {
     el.textContent = `custom_${props.columnInfo.header}`;
  }
}
```

In order to apply the `CustomColumnHeader` defined above, the column information object that is provided to the `columns` array in the `header` option must be further configured. Set the `name` property of the column information object as the `name` of the header you want to customize, and set the predefined custom column header to the `renderer` property. Furthermore, if you want to apply custom column headers to [complex columns](./complex-columns.md), it can be applied identically to the `header` option in the `complexColumns` array. 

```javascript
import Grid from 'tui-grid';

const grid = new Grid({
  // ...,
  header: {
    height: 100,
    complexColumns: [
      {
        header: 'info',
        name: 'mergeColumn1',
        childNames: ['id', 'name'],
        renderer: CustomColumnHeader
      }
    ],
    columns: [
      {
        name: 'id',
        renderer: CustomColumnHeader
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

> **Note**
> * Custom column header can be used with `v4.7.0` and up.
> * Options **sortable** and **filter** are ignored in custom column header.
